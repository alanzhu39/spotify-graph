todo:
- start angular project setup
  - brainstorm components skeleton
  - set up typescript linting
- not sure which of the two below to implement first
  - implement spotify auth flow so we can start getting data
  - test graph library
    - maybe can use test data?
    - yes, I think can generate data first before doing full spotify api integration by just downloading json responses from docs for my data
- azure static web app deployment
- readme

In progress:
- brainstorm components skeleton
- test graph library
  - maybe can use test data?
  - yes, I think can generate data first before doing full spotify api integration by just downloading json responses from docs for my data

App components:
- menu-bar
- graph
- auth-overlay

App services:
- auth service
  - handles auth redirect and auth callback (routing)
- graph service
- spotify api service
  - wrapper for spotify api requests
  - include the auth token state here
    - auth service puts token here
    - graph service requests will be automatically authorized

Finished:
- start angular project setup
  - set up typescript linting

Initial brainstorm:
- Main idea is to visualize your Spotify artists in graph form
- related artists (collected via api) are connected in the graph
- the idea is that artists will be clustered by genre, but there might be interesting connections between certain clusters

Implementation details:
- learning Angular to build webapp
- probably just need the frontend, can probably be single page (login overlay, then when signed in it generates the graph)
  - add settings and stuff in a sidebar to make it prettier
- integrate with spotify apis, should be not bad since they have p thorough docs
- find a good graph library, so far visjs looks like it should be good enough
  - use artist images as nodes, with hover labels (or toggleable?) of their names
  - any cluster/edge coloring?
