todo:
- start angular project setup
  - brainstorm components skeleton
  - set up typescript linting
- not sure which of the two below to implement first
  - implement spotify auth flow so we can start getting data
  - test graph library
    - maybe can use test data?

12/4/22:
Initial brainstorm:
- Main idea is to visualize your Spotify artists in graph form
- related artists (collected via api) are connected in the graph
- the idea is that artists will be clustered by genre, but there might be interesting connections between certain clusters

Implementation details:
- learning Angular to build webapp
- probably just need the frontend, can probably be single page (login overlay, then when signed in it generates the graph)
  - add settings and stuff in a sidebar to make it prettier
- integrate with spotify apis, should be not bad since they have p thorough docs
- find a good graph library, so far visjs looks like it should be good enough
  - use artist images as nodes, with hover labels (or toggleable?) of their names
  - any cluster/edge coloring?
