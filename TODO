TODO:

todo:
- change artist size by how many songs are saved?
- graph playlists

12/5/22:
In progress:
- readme
- load testing, making it look pretty
  - should we remove low degree nodes?

Finished:
- deployment
  - deploying to firebase hosting. free and easy to use? can also add custom domain later
  - also made an auto-generated CD github workflow
- update favico
- use env variables
- add logout button
- base background graph
- UI work
  - adding hamburger about menu, feels super clean
    - can potentially use for settings/more graph options in the future
  - maybe try to get some better color palettes, more colorful or smth
  - try to look up some examples
  - also update fonts
- working on html templates/structure and css styles
- spotify access token refresh
- how to get graph data without rate limiting
  - adding timeouts
- moved graph service into graph component
  - don't really need the separate service
  - also lets us do loading and time remaining and stuff
- images work pretty easily



12/4/22:
In progress:
- spotify access token refresh

Reflections:
- highly productive day today, went from project initialization to already 50% working in one day
- spotify auth flow was hella aids cuz of the different string encoding stuff
  - also doing the hashing was not easy, but esp the encoding breaking the libraries was lame
  - apis themselves working nicely
  - need to do access token refresh
- graph library turned out to be more or less plug and play, hope it will be robust enough for the desired features
  - need to make it look pretty
  - need to figure out grouping
  - need to see if it can handle the full data amounts (from me is prob like >2k artists)
- had some more practice with angular and observables, honestly seems kinda cringe

App components:
- menu-bar
- graph
- auth-overlay

App services:
- auth service
  - handles auth redirect and auth callback (routing)
- graph service
- spotify api service
  - wrapper for spotify api requests
  - include the auth token state here
    - auth service puts token here
    - graph service requests will be automatically authorized

Finished:
- spotify api requests working
- spotify auth flow w pkce challenge
- test graph library
  - maybe can use test data?
  - yes, I think can generate data first before doing full spotify api integration by just downloading json responses from docs for my data
- start angular project setup
  - set up typescript linting
- brainstorm components skeleton



12/3/22:
Initial brainstorm:
- Main idea is to visualize your Spotify artists in graph form
- related artists (collected via api) are connected in the graph
- the idea is that artists will be clustered by genre, but there might be interesting connections between certain clusters

Implementation details:
- learning Angular to build webapp
- probably just need the frontend, can probably be single page (login overlay, then when signed in it generates the graph)
  - add settings and stuff in a sidebar to make it prettier
- integrate with spotify apis, should be not bad since they have p thorough docs
- find a good graph library, so far visjs looks like it should be good enough
  - use artist images as nodes, with hover labels (or toggleable?) of their names
  - any cluster/edge coloring?
